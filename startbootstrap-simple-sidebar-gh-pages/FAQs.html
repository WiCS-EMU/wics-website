                        <p>What is this?</p>
                        <ol>The Women in Computer Science Club at EMU is comprised 
                        of female students at EMU who are interested in the field of
                         Computer Science, and the men who support their goals of 
                         increasing female participation in Computer Science. This 
                         club was founded by our faculty advisor Dr. Krish. Narayanan, 
                         and it is run and managed by our volunteer students</ol>

with the goal of encouraging more women to stay and thrive in the field of technology.</li>
<li>Bring female software developers to EMU for Speaker Series events.</li>
<li>Engage in community outreach by teaching young people to code - with a particular emphasis
 on girls and women.</li></ul></ol>
